CodeClarity is an open-source alternative to Snyk, Checkmarx, and Black Duck, offering fast source code analysis to identify dependencies, licenses, and vulnerabilities instantly.

It runs fully on-premises, giving you full control over your code.

Integrate CodeClarity into your CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, Bash) to block vulnerable code automatically.

Create custom analysis pipelines by linking plugins. Currently, there are three in-house plugins (SBOM builder, vulnerability finder, license finder) and one external (CodeQL), with more coming soon.

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary tools and dependencies to develop on CodeClarity. It includes Docker containers, build scripts, and configuration files required to set up your local development environment.

## License

This project is licensed under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.  You can find the full license details in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

## Requirements

*   **curl:** Used for downloading the setup script and dumps.
*   **make:** Used for automating certain build and deployment tasks.
*   **golang >= 1.24** Used for plugins and downloadable [here](https://go.dev/dl/).
*   **Docker:**  A containerization platform.  [Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) are available on the Docker website.
*   **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. [Installation instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04) can be found here.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download and Execute the Setup Script

This script automates the cloning of the development environment repository and initiates the setup process.
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeClarityCE/codeclarity-dev/main/setup.sh && sh setup.sh
```

### 2. Update DB (Optional)

Please apply for an NVD API key [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key), and fill it in `codeclarity-dev/.cloud/env/.env.makefile`.

Run the command to update the knowledge DB:

```bash
make knowledge-update
```

Your development environment is now set up.

### 3. Make Commands
Once the initial configuration is complete, you no longer need to execute the setup script to start the platform. 
Use ```make``` to list all the possible actions:

```bash
