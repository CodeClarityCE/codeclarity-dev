CodeClarity is an open-source alternative to Snyk, Checkmarx, and Black Duck, offering fast source code analysis to identify dependencies, licenses, and vulnerabilities instantly.

It runs fully on-premises, giving you full control over your code.

Integrate CodeClarity into your CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, Bash) to block vulnerable code automatically.

Create custom analysis pipelines by linking plugins. Currently, there are three in-house plugins (SBOM builder, vulnerability finder, license finder) and one external (CodeQL), with more coming soon.
